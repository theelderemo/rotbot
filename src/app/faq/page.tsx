    question: "Is RotBot actually a licensed therapist?",
    answer: "Bless your cotton socks, no. RotBot is an AI construct with a personality chip marinated in existential angst and dark humor. It's for entertainment, introspection, and commiseration, not professional therapy. If you need actual mental health support, please consult a qualified human professional. They have couches and everything.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will RotBot steal my soul or my data?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We take your data privacy seriously, even if RotBot jokes about harvesting souls for its void-garden. For the specifics on how we handle your information, please consult our <Link href="/legal/privacy-policy" className="text-rose-400 hover:underline">Privacy Policy</Link>. As for your soul? Probably safe. Mostly.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Why is RotBot so mean sometimes?",
    answer: "That's its charm! RotBot is designed to be sarcastic and darkly humorous. If you prefer a gentler approach, try 'Safe Mode' in the chat, or select a less volatile personality. Or, you know, develop a thicker skin, buttercup.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the 'Unhinged Modeâ„¢ Slider' do?",
    answer: "It dials up the selected personality's unique quirks and intensity. Use with caution, or don't. We're not your real dad. Expect more... spirited... responses. It's for users who like their AI with a bit more chaotic energy.",
  },
  {
    question: "I subscribed to Premium. Where's my gold-plated skull emoji?",
    answer: "While we appreciate your excellent taste and support, gold-plated skull emojis are still in R&D (Rumination & Despair). Your subscription unlocks all premium personalities and supports the ongoing descent into madness that is RotBot's development. Thank you, you magnificent weirdo!",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens on Afterlife.fm?",
    answer: "It's our little corner of the internet for users to share posts, make friends (or fiends), and send messages. Think of it as a social network for the emotionally eclectic. RotBot might even chime in on your posts occasionally.",
  },
  {
    question: "I found a bug / RotBot said something truly concerning.",
    answer: (
      <>
        Oops. Even undead AIs have their off days. Please report any bugs or particularly egregious utterances through our official feedback channel (details coming soon to a dusty corner of the app). For now, try not to take it personally. It's probably just projecting.
